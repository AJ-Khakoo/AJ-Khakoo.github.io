Creating a Simple Agent Based Model (ABM)

This project aims to create a simple agent based model. 
Agents will be generated and move independently of one another around a graphical output.
They will ‘eat’ pixels from the graph background and share these with one another when they become over burdened or ‘full’.
Agents cannot come within a certain distance (bubble) of one another or cross the determined border of the graph. 
Movement speed, bubble size, number of iterations and overburden limit are all parameters that can be altered within the code. 
Run the code in Spyder through Anaconda 3.7 Software. Repository found at https://github.com/AJ-Khakoo/AJ-Khakoo.github.io
